# Restful API
* Current application was already running as Restful API service, so it makes sense to retain the existing Rest APIs.
* Rest API is widely used architecture to expose APIs to public domain. This helps to expose our application to third party users in future. 
* All the API's exposed by the application to the front end are based on Rest architecture.

# gRPC
* To reduce the latency in internal service communication gRPC protocol is used.
* gRPC also helps in maintaining the dependencies required by each microservice to reduce breaking changes. It will be as good as calling a function inside the code.
* All internal communication from API gateway to person microservice is done via gRPC.

# Kafka
* We expect the location of user to be updated frequently and that is why Kafka is used internally to save the Location data asynchronously.
* As more number of requests to update the location are made, Kafka efficently handles the incoming requests with queue to reduce load on the Location service.
* With Kafka implementation below decisions were taken -
** API Gateway service publishes location related messages to a topic.
** Location service consumes the published location message to save it to database. 
**The code for consumer is written in __init__ file to make sure that the service starts the kafka consumer on startup and continuously listens to any message that is published to the topic.
** Location service also has a get function that is part of restful service called by API gateway service to get location data. So Kafka consumer has been added in the same restful service.
** With this design, Location service will also cater for any future enhancements that will arise for the service.
